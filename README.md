## Introduction

Our proposed solution addresses the challenges inherent in group projects, aiming to create a more effective and equitable group project experience. We enhance user interaction by incorporating game elements into the solution design. This project is developed for Microsoft’s Imagine Cup, with a specific focus on tackling the challenges of group projects in the education sector.

## Solution Components

At its core, our solution comprises three main components:

1. **Accountability:** Emphasizing accountability not only for individual team members but also fostering a sense of responsibility among teammates.

2. **Workload Resolution:** Resolving the workload of educators (professors & TA’s) through a proportionate grading system, ensuring a fair distribution of tasks among students.

3. **Anonymous Feedback System:** Implementing an anonymous compliment and critique system to provide constructive feedback while maintaining a positive and collaborative environment.
